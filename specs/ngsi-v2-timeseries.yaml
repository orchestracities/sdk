        This endpoint is intended for administrators of QuantumLeap. Using the information returned by this endpoint they can diagnose problems in the service or its dependencies. This information is also useful for cloud tools such as orchestrators and load balancers with rules based on health-checks. Due to the lack of a standardized response format, we base the implementation on the draft of https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/
        QuantumlLeap's dependencies are the following: - CrateDB: Critical - Redis:   Critical only if geocoding is enabled. - OSM:     Non-critical

          will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results
          will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the
          average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However,
          with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature
          instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days
          within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied
          by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric
          attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will
          be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope
          to create aggregation across entities.

        the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or
        across them [global].

    aggrPeriod:
      name: aggrPeriod
      in: query
      description: Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the
        values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function
        will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results
        will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average
        temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an
        aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead
        (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within
        the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod,
        and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified
        in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default,
        the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation
        across entities.

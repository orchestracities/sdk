History of an attribute of a given entity instance.

For example, query max water level of the central tank throughout the last year.
Queries can get more sophisticated with the use of filters and query attributes.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_id = 'entity_id_example' # str | The entity id in which the query is restricted on. If the id is unique among all entity types, this could be used to uniquely identify the entity instance. Otherwise, you will have to use the entityType attribute to resolve ambiguity.
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                   |

History of an attribute (values only) of a given entity instance.

Similar to the previous, but focusing on the values regardless of the metadata.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_id = 'entity_id_example' # str | The entity id in which the query is restricted on. If the id is unique among all entity types, this could be used to uniquely identify the entity instance. Otherwise, you will have to use the entityType attribute to resolve ambiguity.
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                   |
| **options**             | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output.

History of N attributes of a given entity instance.

For example, query the average pressure, temperature and humidity of this month
in the weather station WS1.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_id = 'entity_id_example' # str | The entity id in which the query is restricted on. If the id is unique among all entity types, this could be used to uniquely identify the entity instance. Otherwise, you will have to use the entityType attribute to resolve ambiguity.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                   |
| **options**             | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output.

| **offset**              | **int** | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don&#39;t give more offset than the number of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [optional]                   |
| **georel**              | **str** | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry).

History of N attributes (values only) of a given entity instance.

For example, query the average pressure, temperature and humidity (values only,
no metadata) of this month in the weather station WS1.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_id = 'entity_id_example' # str | The entity id in which the query is restricted on. If the id is unique among all entity types, this could be used to uniquely identify the entity instance. Otherwise, you will have to use the entityType attribute to resolve ambiguity.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`.

If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                   |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                   |
| **options**             | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output.

| **offset**              | **int** | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don&#39;t give more offset than the number of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [optional]                   |
| **georel**              | **str** | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry).

> attr_name, id=id, aggr_method=aggr_method, aggr_period=aggr_period,
> aggr_scope=aggr_scope, options=options, from_date=from_date, to_date=to_date,

History of an attribute of N entities of the same type.

For example, query the pressure measurements of this month in all the weather
stations. Note in the response, the index and values arrays are parallel. Also,
when using aggrMethod, the aggregation is done by-entity instance. In this case,
the index array is just the fromDate and toDate values user specified in the
request (if any).

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_type = 'entity_type_example' # str | The entity type in which the query is restricted on. Used to constraint the search to entities of this type, specially useful when the entity id is not enough to uniquely identify an entity.
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)

to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)

| **attr_name**           | **str** | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |

History of an attribute (values only) of N entities of the same type.

For example, query the average pressure (values only, no metadata) of this month
in all the weather stations.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_type = 'entity_type_example' # str | The entity type in which the query is restricted on. Used to constraint the search to entities of this type, specially useful when the entity id is not enough to uniquely identify an entity.
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)

(To Be Implemented) History of N attributes of N entities of the same type.

For example, query the average pressure, temperature and humidity of this month
in all the weather stations.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_type = 'entity_type_example' # str | The entity type in which the query is restricted on. Used to constraint the search to entities of this type, specially useful when the entity id is not enough to uniquely identify an entity.
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |

(To Be Implemented) History of N attributes (values only) of N entities of the
same type.

For example, query the average pressure, temperature and humidity (values only,
no metadata) of this month in all the weather stations.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
entity_type = 'entity_type_example' # str | The entity type in which the query is restricted on. Used to constraint the search to entities of this type, specially useful when the entity id is not enough to uniquely identify an entity.
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |

For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don&#39;t give more offset than the number of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [optional]                              |
| **georel**              | **str** | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification.

| **geometry**            | **str** | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [optional]                              |
| **coords**              | **str** | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. &#x60;40.714,-74.006&#x60; is okay, but not &#x60;40 42&#39; 51&#39;&#39;,74 0&#39; 21&#39;&#39;&#x60;.

(To Be Implemented) History of an attribute of N entities of N types.

For example, query the average temperature of this month in all the devices
capable of measuring temperature. In this case, you are responsible for
providing entity types which contain the attrName.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

try:
    # (To Be Implemented) History of an attribute of N entities of N types.
    api_response = api_instance.reporter_reporter_query_ntne1_a(attr_name, type=type, id=id, aggr_method=aggr_method, aggr_period=aggr_period, aggr_scope=aggr_scope, options=options, from_date=from_date, to_date=to_date, last_n=last_n, limit=limit, offset=offset, fiware_service=fiware_service, fiware_service_path=fiware_service_path)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling QueriesApi->reporter_reporter_query_ntne1_a: %s\n" % e)
```

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |
| **options**             | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output.

(To Be Implemented) History of an attribute (values only) of N entities of N
types.

For example, query the average temperature (values only, no metadata) of this
month in all the devices capable of measuring temperature. In this case, you are
reponsible for providing entity types which contain the attrName.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
attr_name = 'attr_name_example' # str | The name of the attribute the query is interested on. It must be a valid attribute of all the entities covered by the query scope.
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)
fiware_service_path = 'fiware_service_path_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-servicepath' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |
| **options**             | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output.

(To Be Implemented) History of N attributes of N entities of N types.

This is sort of a query all. The response will likely not fit into a single
response so an efficient paging mechanism and sensible defaults will be
required.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth

type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`.

# **reporter_reporter_query_ntnena_value**

> IndexedAllAttribute reporter_reporter_query_ntnena_value(type=type, id=id,
> attrs=attrs, aggr_method=aggr_method, aggr_period=aggr_period,
> aggr_scope=aggr_scope, options=options, from_date=from_date, to_date=to_date,

(To Be Implemented) History of N attributes (values only) of N entities of N
types.

This is sort of a query all. The response will likely not fit into a single
response so an efficient paging mechanism and sensible defaults will be
required.

### Example

-   Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ngsi_timeseries_v2
from ngsi_timeseries_v2.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['X-Gravitee-Api-Key'] = 'Bearer'
configuration = ngsi_timeseries_v2.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): BearerAuth
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = ngsi_timeseries_v2.QueriesApi(ngsi_timeseries_v2.ApiClient(configuration))
type = 'type_example' # str | Comma-separated list of entity types whose data are to be included in the response. Use only one (no comma) when required. If used to resolve ambiguity for the given entityId, make sure the given entityId exists for this entityType. (optional)
id = 'id_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of entity ids whose data are to be included in the response. (optional)
attrs = 'attrs_example' # str | Optional. Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If not specified, all attributes are included in the response in arbitrary order. (optional)
aggr_method = 'aggr_method_example' # str | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data. (optional)
aggr_period = 'aggr_period_example' # str | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. (optional)
aggr_scope = 'entity' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global]. (optional) (default to 'entity')
options = 'options_example' # str | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). Options dictionary to format output. See definition in NGSIv2 for example here: https://orioncontextbroker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/entities/list-entities/list-entities (optional)
from_date = 'from_date_example' # str | Optional. The starting date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
to_date = 'to_date_example' # str | Optional. The final date and time (inclusive) from which the context information is queried. Must be in ISO8601 format (e.g., 2018-01-05T15:44:34) (optional)
last_n = 56 # int | Optional. Used to request only the last N values that satisfy the request conditions. (optional)
limit = 10000 # int | Optional. Maximum number of results to retrieve in a single response. (optional) (default to 10000)
offset = 56 # int | Optional. Offset to apply to the response results. For example, if the query was to return 10 results and you use an offset of 1, the response will return the last 9 values. Make sure you don't give more offset than the number of results. (optional)
georel = 'georel_example' # str | Optional. It specifies a spatial relationship between matching entities and a reference shape (geometry). This parameter is used to perform geographical queries with the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
geometry = 'geometry_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
coords = 'coords_example' # str | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. `40.714,-74.006` is okay, but not `40 42' 51'',74 0' 21''`. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/. (optional)
fiware_service = 'fiware_service_example' # str | The corresponding 'fiware-service' header. See http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/multitenancy/index.html#multi-tenancy (optional)

| **aggr_method**         | **str** | Optional. The function to apply to the raw data filtered by the query parameters. If not given, the returned data are the same raw inserted data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_period**         | **str** | Optional. If not defined, the aggregation will apply to all the values contained in the search result. If defined, the aggregation function will instead be applied N times, once for each period, and all those results will be considered for the response. For example, a query asking for the average temperature of an attribute will typically return 1 value. However, with an aggregationPeriod of day, you get the daily average of the temperature instead (more than one value assuming you had measurements across many days within the scope of your search result). aggrPeriod must be accompanied by an aggrMethod, and the aggrMethod will be applied to all the numeric attributes specified in attrs; the rest of the non-numerical attrs will be ignored. By default, the response is grouped by entity_id. See aggrScope to create aggregation across entities. | [optional]                              |
| **aggr_scope**          | **str** | Optional. (This parameter is not yet supported). When the query results cover historical data for multiple entities instances, you can define the aggregation method to be applied for each entity instance [entity] or across them [global].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [optional][default to &#39;entity&#39;] |

| **geometry**            | **str** | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape to be used for geographical queries and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification. Full details can be found in the Geographical Queries section of the specification: http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [optional]                              |
| **coords**              | **str** | Optional but required if georel is specified. This parameter defines the reference shape (geometry) in terms of WGS 84 coordinates and has the same semantics as in the FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification, except we only accept coordinates in decimal degrees---e.g. &#x60;40.714,-74.006&#x60; is okay, but not &#x60;40 42&#39; 51&#39;&#39;,74 0&#39; 21&#39;&#39;&#x60;.
